          <l>Said Mr. Jones in 1910:</l>
          <l>“Women, subject yourselves to men.”</l>
          <l>Nineteen-Eleven heard him quote:</l>
          <l>“They rule the world without the vote.”</l>
          <l>By Nineteen-Twelve, he would submit</l>
          <l>“When all the women wanted it.”</l>
          <l>By Nineteen-Thirteen, looking glum,</l>
          <l>He said that it was bound to come.</l>
          <l>This year I heard him say with pride:</l>
          <l>“No reasons on the other side!”</l>
          <l>By Nineteen-Fifteen, he’ll insist</l>
          <l>He’s always been a suffragist.</l>
          <l>And what is really stranger, too,</l>
          <l>He’ll think that what he says is true.</l>
