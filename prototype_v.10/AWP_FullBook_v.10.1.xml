                <p>1880—Anti-suffrage arguments are being worn long, calm
  and flowing this year, with the dominant note that of woman’s
  intellectual inferiority.</p>
                <p>1890—Violence is very evident in this season’s <del>fashions</del> <add>modes</add>,
  and our more conservative thinkers are saying that woman suffrage
  threatens the home, the Church and the Republic.</p>
                <p>1900—A complete change of style has taken place.
  Everything is being worn a l’aristocrate, with the
  repeated assertion that too many people are voting already.</p>
                <p>1915—The best line of goods shown by the leading
  anti-suffrage houses this spring is the statement that woman
  suffrage is the same thing as free love. The effect is extremely
  piquant and surprising.</p>

                        <l>“But women,” he continued, “I must own I understand;</l>
                        <l>Women are a contradiction—honorable and

      Fate,</l>

                        <l>“Don’t you think,” began the lady, but he cut her short:
      “I see</l>
                        <l>That you take it personally—women always do,” said
      he.</l>
                        <l>“You will pardon me for saying every woman is the

                        <l>“No, I don’t admit they haven’t,” said the patient lady

                <head>The Unconscious Suffragists</head>
                <p>“They who have no voice nor vote in the electing of
  representatives do not enjoy liberty, but are absolutely enslaved
  to those who have votes.”—Benjamin Franklin.</p>
                <p>“No such phrase as virtual representation was ever known in
  law or constitution.”—James Otis.</p>
                <p>“But these great cities, says my honorable friend, are
  virtually, though not directly represented. Are not the wishes of
  Manchester, he asks, as much consulted as those of any other town
  which sends members to Parliament? Now, sir, I do not understand
  how a power which is salutary when exercised virtually can be
  noxious when exercised directly. If the wishes of Manchester have
  as much weight with us as they would have under a system which
  gives representatives to Manchester, how can there be any danger
  in giving representatives to Manchester?”—Lord Macaulay’s
  Speech on the Reform Bill.</p>
                <p>“Universal suffrage prolongs in the United States the effect
  of universal education: for it stimulates all citizens throughout
  their lives to reflect on problems outside the narrow circle of
  their private interests and occupations: to read about public
  questions; to discuss public characters and to hold themselves
  ready in some degree to give a rational account of their
  political faith.”—Dr. Charles Eliot.</p>
                <p>“But liberty is not the chief and constant object of their
  (the American people) desires: equality is their idol; they make
  rapid and sudden efforts to obtain liberty and if they miss their
  aim, resign themselves to their disappointment; but nothing can
  satisfy them without equality, and they would rather perish than
  lose it.”—De Tocqueville: Democracy in America, 1835.</p>
                <p>“A government is for the benefit of all the people. We believe
  that this benefit is best accomplished by popular government
  because in the long run each class of individuals is apt to
  secure better provision for themselves through their own voice in
  government than through the altruistic interest of others,
  however intelligent or philanthropic.”—William H. Taft in
  Special Message.</p>
                <p>“I have listened to some very honest and eloquent orators whose sentiments were
noteworthy for this: that when they spoke of the people, they were not thinking
of themselves, they were thinking of somebody whom they were commissioned to
take care of. And I have seen them shiver when it was suggested that they
arrange to have something done by the people for themselves.”—The New
Freedom, by Woodrow Wilson.</p>
