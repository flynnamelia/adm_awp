          <p>"As for the democratic daughters of America, who for many reasons might be supposed likely to be well up in such housewifely lore (sewing), they are for the most part so ignorant of it that I have heard the most eloquent preacher of the City of New York advert to their in- capacity in this respect as an impediment to their assistance to the poor."<title>—<persName>Fanny Kemble</persName>'s Journal</title>, <date when="1835">1835</date>.
         </p>
          <p>"Young women of moderate or no fortune are brought up as ignorant of housewifery as if destined to be heiresses of crowns. Is it surprising that marriages are diminishing among us, that young men should hesitate to enter into a connection which threatens but too truly expense and embarrassment, and that of the few who are more adventurous no inconsiderable number are driven to speedy bankruptcy?"—<persName>H.

          <head>YOUTHFUL HYSTERIA.
          </head>
          <p>One of the most weighty arguments against militancy is the bad example set to other turbulent groups</p>
          <p>First, there was Ulster, and now Prince John, aged nine, when reluctant to leave St. James's Park, jumps on a bench and shouts "Votes for Women!" embarrassing his nurse and seriously alarming a Cabinet minister who happened to be passing.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div type="section" n="">
          <head>DID YOU KNOW
          </head>
          <p>That over 40 per cent of the Bachelor of Arts degrees awarded in this country in <date when="1911">1910</date> went to women?</p>
          <p>That the high schools graduate almost a third more girls than boys?</p>
          <p>That over 78 per cent of the teachers are women?</p>
          <p>That only about 10 per cent of the children in the country go to private schools?</p>
          <p>That a prize offered last year for the best yield above 100 bushels an acre of shelled corn for any farmer in the State of Maine was won by a girl?
          </p>
          <p>As that old anti-feminist, Cato the Consul, said: "As soon as they begin to equal us they will have the advantage over us."

        </div>
        <div type="section" n="">
          <head/>
          <p>"In the sixth century," said <persName>Mr. Lane</persName>, of Oregon, in the Senate the other day, "the early fathers of the Christian Church debated with great gravity whether or not woman had a soul: At the Council of Macon, after much discussion, it was voted on, and woman won out by a majority of one. That was a great concession for men to make, was it not? . . . And now here in this day we are questioning her right to participate with ourselves upon full equality in the affairs of men. Whether we will decide by one vote or not, I do not know. I rather suspect that we will not be quite up to the mark set by our old fathers at Macon."
          </p>
          <p>But they were—just exactly.
          </p>
          <p>“Of thy wit I wonder that thou purposest to fight with women. for if fortune be on our side, and if it hap that thou be overcome, then art thou shamed evermore when thou art overcome by women, and if our gods be wroth with us, and thou overcomest us, it shall turn thee to little worship, that thou have the mastery of women.
          </p>
          <p>Which is a translation of a letter that <persName>Bartholomew Anglicus</persName> says the <persName>Queen of the Amazons</persName> wrote to <persName type="fictional">Alexander the Grea</persName>t.

          <p>1. Because no woman will leave her domestic duties to vote.</p>
          <p>2. Because no woman who votes will attend to her domestic duties.</p>
          <p>3. Because it will make dissension between husband and wife.</p>

          <p>9. Because men and women are so different that they must have different duties.</p>
          <p>10. Because men and women are so much alike that men with one vote each can express themselves and us, too.</p>
          <p>11. Because women cannot use force.</p>
          <p>12. Because the militants can and do use force.</p>

          </head>
          <p>Some people think only a federal child labor law will be effective.
          </p>
          <p>At the conference the other day <persName>Mrs. Florence</persName> told a story of a man who had to live in a boat five miles off the coast of <placeName>Maine</placeName> because he had once violated the federal law against stealing scallops; whereas a factory was running very comfortably on the mainland which every day violated the state law against child labor.
          </p>
          <p>"What!" we can imagine the states' rights orators exclaiming, "would you have us regard our children like scallops?"

          <p>(The father of gods and men smiled, and called unto him golden Aphrodite and said: "Not unto thee, my child, are given the works of war, but follow thou after the loving task of wedlock.” Iliad, Bk. V, 425.)</p>

            <l>When Zeus reprimanded his beautiful daughter</l>

            <l>And told her her sphere was the Home, and not slaughter,</l>
            <l>Did she take to the axe and the torch? Not at all.</l>
            <l>She said: "If the home is my sole occupation,</l>

            <l>I think I can make the domestic relation</l>
