          <head>What Governments Say To Women.

          <p>(The law compels a married woman to take the nationality of her husband.)

          <p>In Time of War.

            <lg><l>Help us. Your country needs you;</l>
            <l>Show that you love her,</l>
            <l>Give her your men to fight,</l>
            <l>Ay, even to fall.</l>
            <l>The fair, free land of your birth,</l>
            <l>Set nothing above her,</l>
            <l>Not husband nor son;</l>
            <l>She must come first of all.</l></lg>
            <p>In Time of Peace.
            </p>
            <lg><l>What's this? You've wed an alien.</l>
            <l>Yet you ask for legislation</l>
            <l>To guard your nationality?</l>
            <l>We're shocked at your demand.</l>
            <l>A woman when she marries</l>
            <l>Takes her husband's name and nation;</l>
            <l>She should love her husband only.</l>

          <head>(a) FANCY AND (b) FACT.
          </head>
          <p>(a) "The home will be different, maternity less frequent." —Fanciful anti-suffrage editorial, <title>"The New York Times,"</title> February 14, 1915.
          </p>
          <p>(b) According to the <orgName>Bureau of Vital Statistics</orgName>, the birth rate in <placeName>California</placeName> was 16.7 in 1914, as compared wih 16.4 in 1913. In 1906 it was only 10.3 Women were enfranchised in California in 1910.

          <head>OH, IF WE COULD ONLY THINK LIKE THAT:
          </head>
          <p>A friend of ours, a member of the reasoning sex and of the legal profession, tells us he is opposed to suffrage for the following grounds:
          </p>
          <p>1. Because where women vote their vote has been just like the men's.
          </p>
          <p>2. Because if women voted it would disrupt the government.
          </p>
          <p>3. Because women won't vote anyhow.

          <head>ANOTHER OF THOSE CURIOUS COINCIDENCES.
          </head>
          <p>On February 15 the <orgName>House of Representatives</orgName> passed a bill making it unlawful to ship in interstate commerce the products of a mill, cannery or factory which have been produced by the labor of children under fourteen years.
          </p>
          <p>Forty-three gentlemen voted against it.
          </p>
          <p>Forty-one of these forty-three had also voted against the woman suffrage bill.
          </p>
          <p>Not one single vote was cast against it from any state where women vote for Congressmen.
          </p>

        <div type="section" n="">
          <head>HER ALLIES.
          </head>
          <p>We should like to know how <persName>Mrs. Daniel Markham</persName>, lately appointed a delegate to the <orgName>National Child Labor Committee</orgName>, feels about those forty-one votes cast by anti-suffragists against protection for children. <persName>Mrs. Markham</persName> is president of the <orgName>Connecticut Anti-Suffrage Association</orgName>.

          <head>SONG OF THOSE FORTY-THREE.

          <lg>
            <l>(With Apologies.)</l>
            <l>We love, we love, we love the child,</l>
            <l>But O State's Rights!</l>
            <l>When babies toil, we quite recoil,</l>
            <l>But O State's Rights!</l>
            <l>We wish that they had time for play,</l>
            <l>And need not work at nights,</l>
            <l>We grieve, you see, unspeakably,</l>
            <l>But vote State's Rights.</l>

          <head>OUR OWN ANTI-SUFFRAGE COLUMN.
          </head>
          <p>(Drawn from anti-suffrage letters to <title>"The New York Times"</title> of February 21, 1915.
          </p>
          <p>"The best men I know do not vote."—<persName>Elizabeth E. Goldsmith</persName>.
          </p>
          <p>"Men and women were created to co-operate."—<persName>Henrietta Wheatle</persName>.
          </p>
          <p>"The exponents of this pernicious doctrine have been eminently successful in bringing this question to an issue, and already the influence exerted in many quarters is deplorable."—<persName>Ethel Beyea</persName>.
          </p>
          <p>"The suffragists threaten and trouble the men, and naturally the men feel bound to take some action to placate them."—<persName>Anne D. Murdock</persName>.
          </p>
          <p>"Women must needs be protected by men. Nature decrees it. And to give this protection the men must keep within their own control all the machinery of government, including the making of the laws."—<persName>H. O. Magie.</persName>
          </p>
          <p>(Note: We have heard this same argument a little differently applied: <placeName>Belgium</placeName> must needs be protected by <placeName>Germany</placeName>. Nature decrees it. And to give that protection Germany must needs, etc. . . .)
