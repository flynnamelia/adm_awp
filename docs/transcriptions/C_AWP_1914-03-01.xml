          <p>In 1850 the medical students at Harvard petitioned against opening the medical school to women, on the ground that "whenever a woman should prove herself capable of an intellectual achievement this latter would cease to constitute an honor for the men who had previously prized it.</p>
          <p>"Their wisdom is shown by a letter in <title>"The New York Times"</title> from <persName>Dr. Mall</persName>, of Johns Hopkins, whosays: "This year we shall graduate in medicine eightymen and ten women; two men and four women areleading the class."</p>
            <p>The fact that 40 per cent of the women and only 2½ per cent of the men are among these leaders would indi-cate that men no longer prize leadership.</p>

           <p>The latest available statistics show that in 1900 31 per cent of the girls between ten and fifteen were bread-winners in Alabama a higher percentage than that of any other state except South Carolina. The age of consent is fourteen.</p>
