          <p>A public school teacher, <persName>Mrs. Louise M. Drew</persName>, has applied for leave of absence without pay, in order to take care of her sick mother, and the committee on elementary schools has advocated refusing the request.
          </p>
          <p>We must point out to the committee that, while they can still find women teachers who have never been mothers, they will experience some difficulty in finding those who have never been daughters.

          <p>The rules of the British Service Commission (which is controlled by men) require women employes to resign on their marriage.
          </p>
          <p>This is done, it has been asserted, in order to protect the homes of these women.
          </p>
          <p>Since the war, <title>"The Woman's Journal"</title> says, thousands of married women telephone and telegraph operators have been taken back.
          </p>
          <p>Don't those women's homes need protecting any more?
          </p>
          <p>Or don't the men need the women's jobs any more?

          <p>In <placeName>Belgium</placeName> before the war there was a strong suffrage movement among the women.
          </p>
          <p>They were told woman's sphere was the home.

          <p>The only difficulty that occurs to us off-hand concerning <persName>Mrs. Dodge's</persName> estimate that only 200,000 women in this country believe in suffrage is that the Woman's Suffrage party has enrolled 131,000 members in Greater New York alone.

          <p><persName>Dr. Katharine Davis</persName> said the other day: "I know women who as secretaries are holding down public offices—know more about the work than the man who was elected to the office. They hold their place from one administration to another, and I've heard them praying that the next man elected wouldn't know much about it."

          <p>The Bundesrath of Germany has decided to furnish medical and financial assistance to women at the time of childbirth, in order to "alleviate the anxiety of husbands at the front."
          </p>
          <p>How strange this would sound: "The Bundesrath has decided to furnish assistance to the wounded at the front, in order to alleviate the anxiety of wives and mothers at home."

          <p>When a benefit is suggested for men, the question asked is, Will it benefit men?

          <p>When a benefit is suggested for women, the question is as above.
