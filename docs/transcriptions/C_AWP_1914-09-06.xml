          <p>That women and children were killed by the Zeppelin bombs dropped on Antwerp.</p>
          <p>"The N. Y. Times" has said editorially that it is women "who suffer most from war's evils and have least to say, or to do, regarding entrance on war."</p>

          <head>EIGHTEEN YEARS' DEVELOPMENT IN ANTI-SUFFRAGE.
          </head>
          <p>
            From <persName>Senator Root</persName>'s anti-suffrage speech in 1894:	
          </p>
          <p>
            "If there is one thing settled in the long discussion of this subject it is that suffrage is not a natural right, but is simply a means of government; and the sole question to be discussed is whether government by the suffrage of men and women will be better government than by the suffrage of men alone."	
          </p>
          <p>
            "We are asked to do it. Why? To do it from good nature, to do it because my friend Mr. Lauterbach is a good fellow, because it will please this lady and that lady, . . . to do it, heaven knows, for how many good reasons, but all reasons of good nature, of kindliness, of complaisance, opposed to the simple performance of the duty which we came here to discharge under our oaths."	
          </p>
          <cb/>
          <p>From Hon. <persName>Harold J. Hinman</persName>'s anti-suffrage speech in 1912:</p>
          <p>"If there is one thing settled in the long discussion of this subject it is that suffrage is not a natural right, but is simply a means of government. The question . . . means this: Whether, in the most economical division of function, . . . the work of choosing representatives can be best performed . . . by both sexes or only by the men."
          </p>
          <p>“Why Mr. Speaker, should we be asked to do it? From good nature, because my friend from New York, <persName>Mr. Murray</persName>, is a good fellow; because it will be pleasing to this or that lady to do it for reasons of kindliness, of complaisance, all of them reasons opposed to the simple performance of the duty which we came here to discharge under the constitution which we have sworn to support and defend."
