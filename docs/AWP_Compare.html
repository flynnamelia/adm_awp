    <h2>Scholarly Introduction/h2>
    <p class="description">
      Are Women People? first appeared not between hard covers but in the quick‑moving columns of the New York Tribune, where, from January 1914 to October 1917, Alice Duer Miller published a weekly amalgam of epigrams, mock dialogues, parody legislation, and sharply turned couplets. Gathered and lightly revised for book publication by George H. Doran in June 1915, the sequence offered contemporaries a pocket‑sized arsenal of suffrage rhetoric, at once humorous enough for drawing‑room recital and trenchant enough to circulate at street‑corner rallies. In the century that followed, Miller’s volume lapsed into relative obscurity—excerpted in feminist anthologies but never subjected to the sustained editorial attention routinely granted to canonical male polemicists. This senior undergraduate project, grounded in the theoretical framework of feminist remediation—the deliberate re‑presentation of women’s texts in new media so as to expose and counteract the gendered power structures embedded in textual transmission—remedies that gap with the first born‑digital critical edition that collates every known newspaper witness with the 1915 book text, encodes both in TEI‑XML, and presents a fully navigable facsimile‑plus‑transcription for scholars, students, and general readers.
Miller wrote at the high‑water mark of the American woman‑suffrage campaign. By 1915 the National American Woman Suffrage Association had refined its lobbying machinery; state referenda in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts filled headlines; and the more militant Congressional Union was preparing the picket lines that would scandalise Washington two years later. Newspapers were the movement’s lifeblood. The Tribune—progressive yet respectable, with a weekend circulation exceeding 200,000—offered Miller a national stage and a mixed‑gender readership willing to entertain satire over sermon. Her verses quote, mimic, and ridicule the anti‑suffrage testimonies poured into statehouse hearings: anxieties about women’s “delicacy,” fears that the vote would unsex mothers, and lofty assurances that “good women” had no wish to sully themselves with politics. By marshaling historical freedom fighters—Toussaint L’Ouverture, Simón Bolívar, Giuseppe Garibaldi—against such provincial objections, Miller reframed enfranchisement as the latest chapter in a trans‑Atlantic narrative of liberation.
The 1915 volume condensed eighteen months of column material into eighty succinct pages arranged under five rubrics: “Treacherous Texts,” “Campaign Material,” “Women’s Sphere,” “A Masque of Teachers,” and “The Unconscious Suffragists.” Contemporary reviewers praised the poems’ “sparkling wit” and “merciless logic,” while anti‑suffrage organs dismissed them as “ingenious but unwomanly.” Although Miller continued to write suffrage columns until 1917, neither she nor Doran prepared a second enlarged edition; subsequent printings reset the original plates without alteration. After ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment in 1920, Are Women People? slipped out of print, surviving mainly in special‑collections stacks and the microfilm drawers of newspaper archives. The present edition revives the book at a moment when renewed assaults on bodily autonomy and voting rights render Miller’s question—are women people?—perennially urgent.
