          <h2>A Consistent Anti to Her Son</h2>
<p>

  “Look at the hazards, the risks, the physical dangers that ladies
  would be exposed to at the polls.”
  —Anti-suffrage speech.</p>


  <p>You’re twenty-one to-day, Willie,</p>

  <p>And a danger lurks at the door,</p>

  <p>I’ve known about it always,</p>

  <p>But I never spoke before;</p>

  <p>When you were only a baby</p>

  <p>It seemed so very remote,</p>

  <p>But you’re twenty-one to-day, Willie,</p>

  <p>And old enough to vote.</p>



  <p>You must not go to the polls, Willie,</p>

  <p>Never go to the polls,</p>

  <p>They’re dark and dreadful places</p>

  <p>Where many lose their souls;</p>

  <p>They smirch, degrade and coarsen,</p>

  <p>Terrible things they do</p>

  <p>To quiet, elderly women—</p>

  <p>What would they do to you!</p>



  <p>If you’ve a boyish fancy</p>

  <p>For any measure or man,</p>

  <p>Tell me, and I’ll tell Father,</p>

  <p>He’ll vote for it, if he can.</p>

  <p>He casts my vote, and Louisa’s,</p>

  <p>And Sarah, and dear Aunt Clo;</p>

  <p>Wouldn’t you let him vote for you?</p>

  <p>Father, who loves you so?</p>



  <p>I’ve guarded you always, Willie,</p>

  <p>Body and soul from harm;</p>

  <p>I’ll guard your faith and honor,</p>

  <p>Your innocence and charm</p>

  <p>From the polls and their evil spirits,</p>

  <p>Politics, rum and pelf;</p>

  <p>Do you think I’d send my only son</p>

  <p>Where I would not go myself?</p>

<p>For Mr. Webb is not opposed</p>

<p>To woman in her place!</p>



<p>O Mr. Webb, how kind you are</p>

<p>To let us live at all,</p>

<p>To let us light the kitchen range</p>

<p>And tidy up the hall;</p>

<p>To tolerate the female sex</p>

<p>In spite of Adam’s fall.</p>



<p>O girls, suppose that Mr. Webb</p>

<p>Should alter his decree!</p>

<p>Suppose he were opposed to us—</p>

<p>Opposed to you and me<span class="app variant"><span class="rdg-B">!</span><span class="rdg-A">.</span></span></p>

<p>What would be left for us to do—</p>

<p>Except to cease to be?</p>

<p>You, who despise the so-called fairer sex,</p>

 <p>These I can bear, but<span class="app variant"><span class="rdg-B">,</span><span class="rdg-A hidden"></span></span> oh, I own it rankles</p>

 <p>To hear you maundering on about our ankles.</p>



 <p>Tell those old stories, which have now and then</p>

 <p>Been from the Record thoughtfully deleted<span class="app variant"><span class="rdg-B">,</span><span class="rdg-A hidden">;</span></span></p>

 <p>Repeat that <span class="app variant"><span class="rdg-B">favorite one about</span><span class="rdg-A hidden">fine allusion to</span></span>

          <h2>The Revolt of Mother</h2>
          <p>Every true woman feels--—Speech of almost any Congressman.</p>





<p>I am old-fashioned, and I think it right</p>

<p>That man should know, by Nature’s laws eternal,</p>

<p>The proper way to rule, to earn, to fight,</p>

<p>And exercise those functions called paternal;</p>

<p>But even I a little bit rebel</p>

<p>At finding that he knows my job as well.</p>



<p>At least he’s always ready to expound it,</p>

<p>Especially in legislative hall,</p>

<p>The joys, the cares, the halos that surround it,</p>

<p>“How <span class="app variant"><span class="rdg-B">women</span><span class="rdg-A hidden">good wives</span></span> feel”—he knows that best
of all.</p>

<p>In fact his thesis is that no one can</p>

<p>Know what is womanly except a man.</p>



<p>I am old-fashioned, and I am content</p>

<p>When he explains the world of art and science</p>

<p>And government—to him divinely sent—</p>

<p>I drink it in with ladylike compliance.</p>

<p>But cannot listen—no, I’m only human—</p>

<p>While he instructs me how to be a woman.</p>

          <h2>Sonnet</h2>
          
<p>Three bills known as the Thompson-Bewley cannery bills have been
advanced to third reading in the Senate and Assembly at Albany. One
permits the canners to work their employés seven days a week, a
second allows them to work women after 9 p.m. and a third removes
every restriction upon the hours of labor of women and
minors.
—Zenas L. Potter, former chief cannery
investigator for New York State Factory Investigating
Commission.</p>





<p>Let us not to an unrestricted day</p>

<p>Impediments admit. Work is not work</p>

<p>To our employés, but a merry play;</p>

<p>They do not ask the law’s excuse to shirk.</p>

<p>Ah, no, the canning season is at hand,</p>

<p>When summer scents are on the air distilled,</p>

<p>When golden fruits are ripening in the land,</p>

<p>And silvery tins are gaping to be filled.</p>

<p>Now to the cannery with jocund mien</p>

<p>Before the dawn come women, girls and boys,</p>

<p>Whose weekly hours (a hundred and nineteen)</p>

<p>Seem all too short for their industrious joys.</p>

<p>If this be error and be proved, alas</p>

<p>The Thompson-Bewley bills may fail to pass!</p>

          <h2>To President Wilson</h2>
          <p>I hold it as a fundamental principle and so do you, that every
people has the right to determine its own form of government. And
until recently 50 per cent of the people of Mexico have not had a
look-in in determining who should be their governors, or what their
government should be.
—Speech of President Wilson</p>





<p>Wise and just man—for such I think you are—</p>

<p>How can you see so burningly and clear</p>

<p>Injustices and tyrannies afar,</p>

<p>Yet blind your eyes to one that lies so near?</p>

<p>How can you plead so earnestly for men</p>

<p>Who fight their own fight with a bloody hand;</p>

<p>How hold their cause so wildly dear, and then</p>

<p>Forget the women of your native land?</p>

<p>With your stern ardor and your scholar’s word</p>

<p>You speak to us of human liberty;</p>

<p>Can you believe that women are not stirred</p>

<p>By this same human longing to be free?</p>

<p>He who for liberty would strike a blow</p>

<p>Need not take arms, or fly to Mexico.</p>

          <p>
          Where on earth did the idea come from that the ballot is a boon,
          a privilege and an honor? From men.
          —Mrs. Prestonia Mann
          Martin
          </p>

          <p>Man. (Man is often such a goose!)</p>

          <p>Indeed it makes me laugh to see</p>

          <p>How men have struggled to be free.</p>



          <p>Poor Washington,
          who meant so well,</p>

          <p>And Nathan
             Hale and William
          Tell,</p>

          <p>Hampden and Bolivar and
          Pym,</p>

          <p>And L’Ouverture—remember him?</p>



          <p>And Garibaldi
          and Kossuth,</p>

          <p>And some who threw away their youth,</p>

          <p>All bitten by the stupid notion</p>

          <p>That liberty was worth emotion.</p>



          <p>They could not get it through their heads</p>

          <p>That if they stayed tucked up in beds,</p>

          <p>Avoiding politics and strife,</p>

          <p>They’d lead a pleasant, peaceful life.</p>



          <p>Let us, dear sisters, never make</p>

          <p>Such a ridiculous mistake;</p>

          <p>But teach our children o’er and o’er</p>

          <h2>Oh, That Twere Possible!</h2>
         
         <p>With apologies to Lord Tennyson.</p>

         <p>The grant of suffrage to women is repugnant to instincts that
         strike their roots deep in the order of nature. It runs counter to
         human reason, it flouts the teachings of experience and the
         admonitions of common sense.
         —N.Y. Times, Feb. 7, 1915.</p>





         <p>Oh, that ’twere possible</p>

         <p>For me to read The Times</p>

         <p>In the early morning hours,</p>

         <p>In a mood ’twixt wrath and mirth,</p>

         <p>I exclaimed: “Alas, Ye Powers,</p>

           <p>1890—Violence is very evident in this season’s <span class="app variant"><span class="rdg-B"></span><span class="rdg-A hidden">fashions</span></span>
             <span class="app variant"><span class="rdg-B">modes</span><span class="rdg-A hidden"></span></span>, and our more conservative thinkers are saying that woman
          suffrage threatens the home, the Church and the Republic.</p>

          <p>1900—A complete change of style has taken place. Everything is being worn a
             l’aristocrate, with the repeated assertion that too many people are voting
          already.</p>

          <p>1915—The best line of goods shown by the leading anti-suffrage houses this
             spring is the statement that woman suffrage is the same thing as free love.
          The effect is extremely piquant and surprising.</p>

          <h2>But Then Who Cares for Figures</h2>
          <p>An argument sometimes used against paying women as highly as men for the same
          work is that women are only temporarily in industry.</p>

          <p>Forty-four per cent of the women teachers in the public schools of New York

            <span class="app variant"><span class="rdg-B">twenty-six</span><span class="rdg-A hidden"></span></span> per cent of the men teachers have served as long.</p>

            <p>The Bundesrath of Germany has decided to furnish medical and financial
               assistance to women at the time of childbirth, in order “to alleviate the
            anxiety of husbands at the front.”</p>

            <p>How strange this would sound: “The Bundesrath has decided to furnish medical
               assistance to the wounded at the front, in order to alleviate the anxiety of
            wives and mothers at home.”</p>

            <p>When a benefit is suggested for men, the question asked is: “Will it benefit
            men?”</p>

          <h2>Why We Oppose Votes for Men</h2>

            <p>Because man’s place is the armory.</p>



            <p>Because no really manly man wants to settle any question otherwise
            than by fighting about it.</p>



            <p>Because if men should adopt peaceable methods women will no longer
            look up to them.</p>



            <p>Because men will lose their charm if they step out of their natural
             sphere and interest themselves in other matters than feats of arms,
          uniforms and drums.</p>



          <p>Because men are too emotional to vote. Their conduct at baseball
             games and political conventions shows this, while their innate
             tendency to appeal to force renders them peculiarly unfit for the
          task of government.</p>

    <p>In 1875 the Supreme Court of Wisconsin in denying the petition of women to

          <h3>II</h3>



          <p>With apologies to R.L.S.</p>



          <p>A heroine must be polite</p>

          <p>And do what others say is right,</p>

          <p>And think men wise and formidable—</p>

          <p>At least<span class="app variant"><span class="rdg-B"></span><span class="rdg-A hidden">,</span></span> as far as she is able.</p>

          <h2>What Every Woman Must Not Say</h2>


          <p>“I don’t pretend I’m clever,” he remarked, “or very wise,”</p>

          <p>And at this she murmured, “Really,” with the right polite
          surprise.</p>

          <p>“But women,” he continued, “I must own I understand;</p>

          <p>Women are a contradiction—honorable and underhand—</p>

          <p>Constant as the star Polaris, yet as changeable as Fate,</p>

          <p>Always flying what they long for, always seeking what they hate.”</p>

          <p>“Don’t you think,” began the lady, but he cut her short: “I see</p>

          <p>That you take it personally—women always do,” said he.</p>

          <p>“You will pardon me for saying every woman is the same,</p>

          <p><span class="app variant"><span class="rdg-B"></span><span class="rdg-A hidden">Very</span></span>

           <span class="app variant"><span class="rdg-B">always</span><span class="rdg-A hidden"></span></span> sensitive to blame;</p>

           <p>Sweet and passionate are women; weak in mind, <span class="app variant"><span class="rdg-B"></span><span class="rdg-A hidden">but</span></span>
              <span class="app variant"><span class="rdg-B">though</span><span class="rdg-A hidden"></span></span> strong in soul;</p>

              <p>Even you admit, I fancy, that they <span class="app variant"><span class="rdg-B"></span><span class="rdg-A hidden">haven't</span></span>
                 <span class="app variant"><span class="rdg-B">have no</span><span class="rdg-A hidden"></span></span> self-control?”</p>

                 <p>“No, I don’t admit they haven’t,” said the patient lady then,</p>

                 <p>“Or they could not sit and listen to the nonsense talked by men.”</p>

    <p>“I’ve been out seeking a beautiful queen.”</p>

    <p>“Chivalry, Chivalry, what did you find?”</p>

    <p>“Commonplace women, not much to my mind.”This poem appeared in
      the Tribune column in two parts: the first section was published
      on May 24 1914 and the second part was published on March 21
      1915. Image from March 21 1915 issue of the Tribune was included
      in this digital edition due to it being the longer section. Both
      of these newspaper images appear elsewhere in the digital
   edition.</p>

          <p>The men about me laughed and frowned and said: “Go home, because</p>

          <p>The young men said to their mother,</p>

          <p>“Hear us, O dearest and best!</p>

          <p>Time cannot cool or smother</p>

          <p>The love of you in our breast;</p>

          <p>Here is your place<span class="app variant"><span class="rdg-B">,</span></span> and no other—</p>

          <p>Come home and rest<span class="app variant"><span class="rdg-B">.</span></span>”</p>



          <p>And the mother’s heart was grateful</p>

          <p>For the love of her cherished ones,</p>

          <p>And her labor, bitter and hateful,</p>

          <p>She left at the word of her sons,</p>

          <p>Till she heard far off the fateful</p>

          <p>Voices of guns.</p>



          <p>Their love did more enslave her;</p>

          <p>They did not understand</p>

          <p>That none could guard or save her</p>

          <p>When war was on the land<span class="app variant"><span class="rdg-B">,</span><span class="rdg-A hidden"></span></span></p>

          <p>But herself, and God, who gave her</p>

          <p>Heart and mind and hand.</p>

            <h2>The Unconscious Suffragists</h2>

            <p>“They who have no voice nor vote in the electing of representatives do not
               enjoy liberty, but are absolutely enslaved to those who have
            votes.”—Benjamin Franklin.</p>

            <p>“No such phrase as virtual representation was ever known in law or
            constitution.”—James Otis.</p>

            <p>“But these great cities, says my honorable friend, are virtually, though not
               directly represented. Are not the wishes of Manchester, he asks, as much
               consulted as those of any other town which sends members to Parliament? Now,
               sir, I do not understand how a power which is salutary when exercised
               virtually can be noxious when exercised directly. If the wishes of
               Manchester have as much weight with us as they would have under a system
               which gives representatives to Manchester, how can there be any danger in
               giving representatives to Manchester?”—Lord
            Macaulay’s Speech on the Reform Bill.</p>

            <p>“Universal suffrage prolongs in the United States the effect of universal
               education: for it stimulates all citizens throughout their lives to reflect
               on problems outside the narrow circle of their private interests and
               occupations: to read about public questions; to discuss public characters
               and to hold themselves ready in some degree to give a rational account of
               their political faith.”—Dr. Charles
            Eliot.</p>

            <p>“But liberty is not the chief and constant object of their (the American
               people) desires: equality is their idol; they make rapid and sudden efforts
               to obtain liberty and if they miss their aim, resign themselves to their
               disappointment; but nothing can satisfy them without equality, and they
            would rather perish than lose it.”—De Tocqueville: Democracy in America, 1835.</p>

            <p>“A government is for the benefit of all the people. We believe that this
               benefit is best accomplished by popular government because in the long run
               each class of individuals is apt to secure better provision for themselves
               through their own voice in government than through the altruistic interest
            of others, however intelligent or philanthropic.”—William H. Taft in Special Message.</p>

            <p>“I have listened to some very honest and eloquent orators whose sentiments
               were noteworthy for this: that when they spoke of the people, they were not
               thinking of themselves, they were thinking of somebody whom they were
               commissioned to take care of. And I have seen them shiver when it was
               suggested that they arrange to have something done by the people for
               themselves.”—The New Freedom, by Woodrow
            Wilson.</p>
