      <h2>Scholarly Introduction</h2>
      <p>The suffrage poetry of best-selling American writer Alice Duer Miller (1874 - 1942) was first printed alongside other political commentary in her influential Are Women People? column (1914 - 1917) in the New York Tribune and then collected in her books Are Women People? (1915) and Women Are People! (1917). This digital edition, created as a senior undergraduate project, grounded in the theoretical framework of feminist remediation, contextualizes Miller’s 1915 book with the contents of her column during this time period.  While selected poems were later collected in Miller’s 1915 book of the same title, these printed versions omit the paratextual context of the newspaper page and strip the poems of their immediate cultural interventions. Existing digital remediations of these print forms of Miller’s work mirror the codes of permanence that surround print media forms: Miller’s book has been digitized and is widely accessible online, while a digital collection of her newspaper column has not been formally compiled. By returning to the periodical source and encoding its material and rhetorical dimensions, this edition enables readers to encounter Miller’s poetry in the context in which it was first circulated and read.</p>
      <p>The run of Miller’s popular periodical column coincided with her rise in popularity across other genres, marked by her 1916 serialized novel Come out of the Kitchen becoming a bestseller and inspiring a popular film. Although Miller wrote over 25 popular novels and was a regular contributor to top literary magazines, her poetry has largely framed her career. Miller’s first book was a collection of poems she published with her sister Caroline during her studies at Barnard College, where she graduated Phi Beta Kappa with a degree in Mathematics and Astronomy in 1899. Her last and best-known work was The White Cliffs (1940), a verse novel describing a love affair between an American woman and a British soldier during World War I, which topped bestseller lists with over 700,000 copies sold worldwide, was read by Lynn Fontanne in a radio broadcast and quickly adapted into a film, and earned Miller numerous accolades and recognition nationwide.</p>
      <p>The political influence of Alice Duer Miller during her lifetime contrasts with her relative obscurity following her death. The dearth of academic scholarship on Miller has been an identified research gap for over two decades (Coyne; Chapman “Poetry and Politics”). The core of this body of scholarship consists of the 1945 biography by Miller's husband (Miller "All Our Lives"), Mary Chapman’s research and analysis of Miller’s suffrage writing (“Poetry and Politics”; “Magpie Habit”), Patrick Coyne’s 2010 bio-bibliography, Anne Morey’s 2013 analysis of novel to film adaption, and the study of humour in Miller’s writing (Hernandez-Corkey; Klaiber; Dresner) and John Gough’s recent annotated editions. Several of Miller's books and plays have been published online by Project Gutenberg, the Library of Congress, or by individuals. One notable example is an online archive dedicated to Miller's work, which was created by Mike Munford in 2006. Recent increased interest in Miller’s work has been attributed to the dissemination of her work on popular public digital platforms. There has been a noticeable amount of media attention paid to Miller’s suffrage poetry over the past four years with the centennial of women’s suffrage and the overturning of Roe v. Wade (holtfan; Rumens; Marcotte; Mikkelson; Lederle; Rooney; ). Recent increased interest in Miller’s work has been attributed to the dissemination of her work on popular public digital platforms (Coyne).</p>
