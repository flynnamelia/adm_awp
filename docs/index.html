    <h2>About This Digital Edition</h2>
    <p style="text-align: center">This experimental digital edition presents a scholarly exploration of the popular suffrage poetry of American writer Alice Duer Miller, that reframes the contents of her book <em>Are Women People?</em> (1915) in the political, social, and historical contexts surrounding their initial appearance in her Are Women People? column (1914-1917) in the <em>New York Tribune</em>.</p> 
<p style="text-align: center">
      This digital edition consists of three main parts: (1) an ebook encoded using the TEI critical apparatus method that is embedded on the site and available to download, (2) an experimental comparative digital edition adapted from the TEI ebook that allows you to view periodical images alongside textual shifts between publications, and (3) a newspaper archive that features all issues of Miller’s column between 1914 and 1915 and provides users with hand-transcriptions of her column, a gallery of newspaper page images, and relevant metadata.

      <h2>Scholarly Introduction</h2>
      <p>The suffrage poetry of best-selling American writer Alice Duer Miller (1874 - 1942) was first printed alongside other political commentary in her influential Are Women People? column (1914 - 1917) in the <emp>New York Tribune</emp> and then collected in her books Are Women People? (1915) and Women Are People! (1917). This digital edition, created as a senior undergraduate project, grounded in the theoretical framework of feminist remediation, contextualizes Miller’s 1915 book with the contents of her column during this time period.  While selected poems were later collected in Miller’s 1915 book of the same title, these printed versions omit the paratextual context of the newspaper page and strip the poems of their immediate cultural interventions. Existing digital remediations of these print forms of Miller’s work mirror the codes of permanence that surround print media forms: Miller’s book has been digitized and is widely accessible online, while a digital collection of her newspaper column has not been formally compiled. By returning to the periodical source and encoding its material and rhetorical dimensions, this edition enables readers to encounter Miller’s poetry in the context in which it was first circulated and read.</p>
      <p>Born July 28, 1874, on Staten Island into a socially prominent family, Alice Duer Miller became one of the best-selling American authors of the first half of the twentieth century. In 1899, she married Henry Wise Miller, with whom she would share a lifelong intellectual partnership and who wrote the only existing biography on her life shortly after her death.</p>
      <p>The run of Miller’s popular periodical column coincided with her rise in popularity across other genres, marked by her 1916 serialized novel Come out of the Kitchen becoming a bestseller and inspiring a popular film. Although Miller wrote over 25 popular novels and was a regular contributor to top literary magazines, her poetry has largely framed her career. Miller’s first book was a collection of poems she published with her sister Caroline during her studies at Barnard College, where she graduated Phi Beta Kappa with a degree in Mathematics and Astronomy in 1899. Her last and best-known work was The White Cliffs (1940), a verse novel describing a love affair between an American woman and a British soldier during World War I, which topped bestseller lists with over 700,000 copies sold worldwide, was read by Lynn Fontanne in a radio broadcast and quickly adapted into a film, and earned Miller numerous accolades and recognition nationwide.</p>
      <p>The political influence of Alice Duer Miller during her lifetime contrasts with her relative obscurity following her death. The dearth of academic scholarship on Miller has been an identified research gap for over two decades (Coyne; Chapman “Poetry and Politics”). The core of this body of scholarship consists of the 1945 biography by Miller's husband (Miller "All Our Lives"), Mary Chapman’s research and analysis of Miller’s suffrage writing (“Poetry and Politics”; “Magpie Habit”), Patrick Coyne’s 2010 bio-bibliography, Anne Morey’s 2013 analysis of novel to film adaption, and the study of humour in Miller’s writing (Hernandez-Corkey; Klaiber; Dresner) and John Gough’s recent annotated editions. Several of Miller's books and plays have been published online by Project Gutenberg, the Library of Congress, or by individuals. One notable example is an online archive dedicated to Miller's work, which was created by Mike Munford in 2006. Recent increased interest in Miller’s work has been attributed to the dissemination of her work on popular public digital platforms. There has been a noticeable amount of media attention paid to Miller’s suffrage poetry over the past four years with the centennial of women’s suffrage and the overturning of Roe v. Wade (holtfan; Rumens; Marcotte; Mikkelson; Lederle; Rooney). Recent increased interest in Miller’s work has been attributed to the dissemination of her work on popular public digital platforms (Coyne).</p>

      <p>Of Miller’s books, Are Women People! is arguably her most widely available text online, with ebooks available on Project Gutenberg, Internet Archive, Wikipedia, and the Library of Congress. While print scans of the entire run of Miller’s Are Women People? column in the Tribune can be found in researchers’ private collections (Chapman), and blog posts have pointed to digital archives such as the Fulton History website, where you can search for scans of Miller’s column, there does not appear to be a location online in which Miller’s Are Women People? column can be easily accessed. This project attempts to address this gap.</p>
      <p>As many scholars in both feminist and periodical studies have articulated, context is crucial for reading and understanding the meaning of a text. Read independently, many of the poems in Are Women People?, such as “Why We Oppose Pockets For Women” or “Chivalry,” seem like they could have been written today. However, timeless these decontextualized texts may seem, this “Book of Rhymes for Suffrage Times,” as the subtitle clarifies, is deeply entrenched in temporal and political contexts key to understanding and appreciating her work. While reading Are Women People? as a “Book of Rhymes” provides us with a curated collection of Miller’s work that is easily preserved, circulated, and recognized over time, something is lost when reading these poems outside the context of “the New York Tribune, in whose generous columns many of these verses first appeared” (Miller, prelims). Recognizing the “Suffrage Times” from which this “Book of Rhymes” was derived allows us to gain deeper insight into Miller’s literary, political, and feminist work.</p>
      <p>Connections throughout Miller’s book might be lost through the remediaiton of her poetry from newspaper to book. One such case can be found by looking at the Are Women People column in the January 10, 1915, issue of the Tribune and pages 55-59 of the book. Two pieces published in Miller’s Tribune column on January 10, 1915, mark the transition from the second and third parts of Miller’s book: Miller’s response “To the Great Dining Out Majority” marks the end of the section of her book on “Campaign Material,” and her poem “Many Men to Any Woman” begins the “Women’s Sphere” section.</p>
            <p>In the context of the column, these two poems are surrounded by other clippings discussing the war, city law enforcement, and women's involvement in first responder careers. Miller also uses her platform to align her voices of women with those of Indigenous people. (Outdated language pasted for historical accuracy.)</p>
      <blockquote>
        <h3>Indians May Lose Rich Power Sites—No Plan for Payment.”</h3> 
<p>Chorus of Women and Indians:
“Isn't it great <br> To be wards of the state, <br> Without any power to influence fate!”</p></blockquote>
      <p>“To the Great Dining Out Majority” contrasts the absurdity of upper-class assumptions underpinning anti-suffrage propaganda with the reality of the majority of working-class women to reveal out-of-touch and classist flaws in the opposition’s stance. Rather than directly attacking the anti-suffrage group, the passage lets the absurdity of their position reveal itself through contrast and implication. This strategy is effective because it avoids overt polemic and instead invites the reader to recognize the flaws in the opposition’s stance through observation and reason. The message is clear: denying women the vote is not about protecting them, but about preserving a social order that benefits a privileged few.</p>
      <p>Reading this excerpt from the book in the context of the column on January 10, 1915, reveals that “the same association” (New York State Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage)  “objects to the proposal to introduce into our school histories some facts about the progress of woman suffrage in the country.”</p>
      <p>“Many Men to Any Women” satirizes the patronizing attitude of men who oppose women’s suffrage by showing how they impose impossible, contradictory standards to justify withholding basic political rights.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <h3>Many Men to Any Women</h3>
        <p>If you have beauty, charm, refinement, tact,</p>
        <p>If you can prove that should I set you free,</p>
        <p>You would not contemplate the smallest act</p>
        <p>That might annoy or interfere with me.</p>
        <p>If you can show that women will abide</p>
        <p>By the best standards of their womanhood—</p>
        <p>(And I must be the person to decide</p>
        <p>What in a woman is the highest good);</p>
        <p>If you display efficiency supreme</p>
        <p>In philanthropic work devoid of pay;</p>
        <p>If you can show a clearly thought-out scheme</p>
        <p>For bringing the millennium in a day:</p>
        <p>Why, then, dear lady, at some time remote,</p>
        <p>I might consider giving you the vote.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The repetition of conditional clauses, marked by the anaphora of the word “It” repeated at the beginning of lines 1, 2, 5, 9 and 11, forms a pattern of gatekeeping through language where rights are granted hypothetically, dependent on impossible or subjective standards. Masculist rhetoric is centred through the first-person singular male speaker, addressing the female “you”. The male speaker has the power and authority to grant the woman addressee freedom through the vote. The first quatrain of this Shakespearean sonnet sets up the conditions of gatekeeping upon which political power and freedom might be given to women. Performing well and possessing the right qualities, like “beauty, charm, refinement, tact” (1), are not enough to prove that the “I” should set you free from this hierarchical environment. The woman must also, not convince, but somehow “prove” that upon being granted freedom, she would not become a threat to her oppressor: You would not contemplate the smallest act / That might annoy or interfere with me.” (3-4). The following quatrain reiterates this general message and in doig so reveals underlying power structures. The nature of this address in gender and number is made explicit in the first two lines of the following quatrain:  “If you can show that women will abide / By the best standards of their womanhood—”. The use of the plural “women” here reveals that it places the burden of representation on the “you” she must prove that all women are worthy. The poem places the burden of representation on the “you” to prove that all women are worthy, regardless of whether the “you” has a singular or plural referent. This is a rhetorical trap, where individual women are disqualified based on the assumed flaws of others. This weaponized ambiguity is also used in the “best standards” that are left overtly undefined, as the speaker controls the meaning but refuses to disclose it. This is a strategy of vagueness used as power. This address is broken by an aside contained within parentheses, revealing that “best standards” are defined by “the person,” or the grammatically first person singular (male) authority: “And I must be the person to decide /What in a woman is the highest good” (7-8). Additional hierarchies and power structures are revealed through the seemingly rational conditions of the third quatrain. Being able to “display efficiency supreme / In philanthropic work devoid of pay” is a condition that presents additional barriers to women who need to work paid jobs, and restricts freedom to those who can afford not to work. Not to mention the upper-class implications in the performance of “philanthropic work” as a marker of value. This resonates with the contradictions revealed in “To the Great Dining Out Majority” elsewhere in this column. Then it imposes even more unreasonable conditions, asking for a “clearly thought-out scheme” for “bringing the millennium in a day” (11-12). Not only does this expose the irrationality of this timeframe, but it also might be a biblical reference to Jesus’ 1,000-year reign in which God’s promises to man were kept, illustrating weaponized religious references and underscoring the way women must be superhuman in order to keep the promises men make to them. That being said, this line almost carries a prophetic undertone when reading it in the year 2025 and looking back at the major advances in women’s rights that were brought as the second millennium comes to a close. After laying out these conditions for freedom, a twist is introduced in the final couplet of this Shakespearian sonnet: “Why, then, dear lady, at some time remote, / I might consider giving you the vote.” The volta delivers the poem’s most direct and devastating final blow. It underscores the futility of the entire premise and exposes how underneath supposedly reasonable demands is a complete unwillingness to relinquish control. No matter what a woman does, her rights and freedoms are still up to male discretion.</p>
      <p>The this poem is supplemented by other poems included in this column. The themes of freedom are also replicated in a list poem titled: “Why Canary Birds Prefer Cages”.</p>
     <blockquote> <h3>Why Canary Birds Prefer Cages</h3>
      <p>A little Southern boy who was given a canary bird in a cage was asked by a tender-hearted relation to set it free. He answered that this was inexpedient, for the following reasons:</p><p>
<p>That keeping it in a cage obliged him to feed and tend it, and that this developed his character beneficially.</p><P>
<p>That he enjoyed hearing it sing.</P>
<p>That it is the nature of canary birds to live in cages. He had had three, and they had all come in cages.</P>
<p>That if he set it free, it would fly away and never come back.</P>
<p>It had never told him it wished for freedom. Canary birds could have anything they wanted, but they must make their wishes known.</p></blockquote>
      <p>Unlike “Many Men to Any Woman,” the speaker here is a young boy. The canary bird represents women (or any group denied autonomy), and the boy represents those in power. Claiming that keeping the bird captive “developed his character beneficially” reflects the rhetoric of benevolent sexism, where controlling is justified on the grounds of care and protection, or to the mutual benefit of improving the character of the oppressor. The bird’s worth is tied to the pleasure it provides him from “hearing it sing.” The assumption that it is “the nature of canary birds to live in cages,” drawing on selective or limited memory that “He had had three, and they had all come in cages” to make this assumption. The fear of abandonment or female independence is conveyed through the line that “if he set it free, it would fly away and never come back.” The idea that a canary bird must verbally express a desire for freedom is absurd. The irony lies in the expectation that the powerless must communicate in the language of the powerful in order to be heard, reflecting a broader truth about systemic injustice, which frequently places the burden of proof on the oppressed, suggesting that they are free or content unless they explicitly and acceptably articulate their dissatisfaction. The satire exposes how this logic is not only unreasonable but deeply manipulative: it denies agency while pretending to offer it, making freedom contingent on an expression that the system itself prevents. In doing so, it highlights how power structures sustain themselves by demanding evidence of discontent from those they have silenced.</p>

<h3>Editorial and Methods Statement</h3>
      <p>The editorial principles guiding the creation of this digital edition reflect what I see as a form of feminist remediation that centers difference and context over the same and original through the (ab)use of standard practices related to text and image reproduction. While my digital edition combines a bound collection of poems with images of the column in which they were first printed, many existing digital editions aim to make a print artifact available in digital form either through facsimile image reproductions of the original artifact or through a transcribed, formatted or encoded reproduction of its textual content. Evidence of this can be found not only in the abundance of digital editions focused on digitizing manuscripts and print books, but also in the standards that guide the production of digital editions that reflect the prioritization of genealogy and authority, such as the guidelines published by MLA and TEI.  
</p>
<p>Rather than re-transcribe a publicly available digitized source, I deliberately redirected effort away from redundant reproduction and toward the interpretive and structural decisions that might make a digital edition valuable and useful. I chose to remediate it by positioning it within a critical framework that foregrounds reproduction as a <emp>choice</emp>, not an imperative for credibility and cultural value. Rather than conforming to rigid editorial norms, this edition engages with TEI in a way that reflects feminist values: accessibility over authority, intimacy over distance, and dialogue over determinism. A resistance to techno-patriarchal systems that demand standardization, expertise, and control over messy, human narratives. By using AI-assisted workflows and pre-existing digital copies, I deliberately redirected effort away from redundant reproduction and toward the interpretive and structural decisions that make digital editions valuable. This approach resists the legacy of uncredited transcription labour, often performed by women, and instead embraces remediation as a feminist, ethical, and scholarly intervention.
</p>
<p>The methodological and editorial approach taken by this project is one that is non-linear, experimental, and prioritizes freedom of exploration and expression. The following discussion will be broken down into three parts aligned with the structure of this website interface. 
</p>
<p>This edition began as a TEI file encoded with the open online XML editor, LEAF-writer. A final prototype of this edition can be found here (https://leaf-writer.leaf-vre.org/view?provider=github&owner=flynnamelia&ownerType=user&repo=adm_awp&path=prototype_v.10&filename=AWP_FullBook_v.10.2.xml). It included annotations and a tagging schema devised around the “tag abuse” of <add> and <del> tags, with newspaper images included through the <pb facs = “”> method in line with the platform’s interface and the encoder’s existing knowledge base. Most of the first three sections of the book were encoded in verse, but a few parts used paragraph tags when this format was evidently more appropriate. The final section of the book consisted of a short play and a series of quotations, and was tagged using the drama and prose modules accordingly.
